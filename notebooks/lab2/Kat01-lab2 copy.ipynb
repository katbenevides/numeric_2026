    "\n",
    "When attempting to solve differential equations on a computer, there are\n",
    "two main sources of error. The first, *round-off error*, derives from\n",
    "the fact that a computer can only represent real numbers by *floating\n",
    "point* approximations, which have only a finite number of digits of\n",
    "accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mathematical note [floating point notation](#floating-point)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we all know that the number $\\pi$ is a non-repeating\n",
    "decimal, which to the first twenty significant digits is\n",
    "$3.1415926535897932385\\dots$ Imagine a computer which stores only eight\n",
    "significant digits, so that the value of $\\pi$ is rounded to\n",
    "$3.1415927$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations, these five digits of accuracy may be sufficient.\n",
    "However, in some cases, the results can be catastrophic, as shown in the\n",
    "following example: $$\\frac{\\pi}{(\\pi + 0.00000001)-\\pi}.$$ Since the\n",
    "computer can only “see” 8 significant digits, the addition\n",
    "$\\pi+0.00000001$ is simply equal to $\\pi$ as far as the computer is\n",
    "concerned. Hence, the computed result is $\\frac{1}{0}$ - an undefined\n",
    "expression! The exact answer $100000000\\pi$, however, is a very\n",
    "well-defined non-zero value.\n",

This is called a *computational* or *numerical instability*, because it is an artifact of the discretization process only. This instability is not a characteristic of the heat conduction problem alone, but is present in other problems where such schemes are used. Furthermore, as we will see below, even a scheme such as forward Euler can be unstable for certain problems and choices of the time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a way to determine the stability properties of a scheme, and that is to apply the scheme to the *test equation* $$\\frac{dz}{dt} = \\lambda z$$ where $\\lambda$ is a complex constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using this equation may not seem very clear. But if you think in terms of $\\lambda z$ as being the linearization of some more complex right hand side, then the solution to is $z=e^{\\lambda t}$, and so $z$ represents, in some sense, a Fourier mode of the solution to the linearized ODE problem. We expect that the behaviour of the simpler, linearized problem should mimic that of the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the forward Euler scheme to this test equation, results in the following difference formula $$z_{i+1} = z_i+(\\lambda \\Delta t)z_i$$ which is a formula that we can apply iteratively to $z_i$ to obtain\n",

    "        &=& (1+\\lambda \\Delta t)^2 z_{i-1} \\\\\n",
    "        &=& \\cdots \\\\\n",
    "        &=& (1+\\lambda \\Delta t)^{i+1} z_{0}.\\end{aligned}$$ The value of $z_0$ is fixed by the initial conditions, and so this difference equation for $z_{i+1}$ will “blow up” as $i$ gets bigger, if the factor in front of $z_0$ is greater than 1 in magnitude – this is a sign of instability. Hence, this analysis has led us to the conclusion that if\n",
    "$$|1+\\lambda\\Delta t| < 1,$$ then the forward Euler method is stable. For *real* values of $\\lambda<0$, this inequality can be shown to be equivalent to the *stability condition* $$\\Delta t < \\frac{-2}{\\lambda},$$ which is a restriction on how large the time step can be so that the numerical solution is stable."
