These can be found on your local computer: numeric_2024/numlabs/lab2 (you will need to fetch upstream from github to get recent changes from our version to your clone before pulling those changes to your local machine; don't forget to commit your previous labs!). For a given function $\\lambda(T)$, and specified parameter values, you should experiment with various time steps and schemes, and compare the computed results (Note: only the answers to the assigned questions need to be handed in). Look at the different schemes (euler, leap-frog, midpoint, 4th order runge kutta) run them for various total times (tend) and step sizes (dt=tend/npts).\n",
